# Bible Memory PWA

## Wishlist
- [ ] Fuzzy typing: typing a letter near the correct letter should count as correct (for mobile use)
- [ ] backup and import
- [ ] Two way sync with a webdav folder. Sync on every change of anything. When I connect a blank copy of the app to a webdav folder that already has bible memory data in it, import everything.
- [ ] Set bible version on the verse
- [ ] Installable PWA
